# 🚙✨ Unity - Unit 1 - Player Control

## 📖 Overview  
In this Unit, you’ll bring an **Amazing Red Truck** to life on a **floating road among not so fantastic mountains** 🌌.  
Your mission? Drive side-to-side while avoiding (or sometimes smashing into 🤭) obstacles (mostly barrels, idk, I´ll decide later) along the way.  

Along the journey, you’ll:  
- 🛠️ Get comfortable with the **Unity Editor** and workflow.  
- 💻 Create your very first **C# scripts**.  
- 🎮 Program basic **car movement controls** (Easier than getting an actual driver´s license).  
- ✏️ Declare and tweak **variables** to fine-tune how your car behaves.  

---

## 🎯 Project Outcome  
By the end of this Unit, you’ll be able to:  
- Call **basic Unity functions**.  
- Adjust **variables** like `speed` or `turnSpeed` in the Inspector.  
- Watch your little car zoom down the floating road, dodging obstacles in style 🚗💨.

🌟 *This project is a playful introduction to programming in Unity — simple enough to get started, but fun enough to make you feel like a real game developer!*
